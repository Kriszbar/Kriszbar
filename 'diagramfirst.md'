# Humanoid Cognitive and Brain-like Function Development Roadmap

## 1. Foundation of Cognitive Architectures
- Develop biologically-inspired cognitive architectures.
- Implement neural networks that mimic brain activity.

## 2. Cognitive Developmental Robotics (CDR)
- Apply human cognitive development principles to robotics.
- Focus on learning and adaptation through interaction with the environment.

## 3. Enhancement of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
- Design robots capable of understanding human expressions.
- Achieve meaningful social interactions between humans and robots.

## 4. Implementation of Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architecture
- Mimic human cognitive processes in robots.
- Example platforms: iCub humanoid robot.

## 5. Open-Systems Platform for Research
- Utilize platforms like the iCub robot for collaborative research.
- Explore sensory-motor skills, perception, and interaction.

## 6. Cognitive Vision Systems
- Develop cognitively and neurally plausible vision systems for robots.
- Aim for replication of human-like vision capabilities.
